    "-Excellence in statistical graphics consists of complicated ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency. Graphics displays should:\n",
    "- Show the data\n",
    "- Induce the viewer to think about the substance rather than about methodology, graphic design, or how the graph was produced or anything else\n",
    "- Avoid distorting what the data has to say\n",
    "- Present many numbers in a small space\n",
    "- Make large datasets coherent\n",
    "- Encourage the eye to compare different pieces of data\n",
    "- Reveal the data at several levels of detail, from a broad overview to a fine perspective\n",
    "- Serve a reasonably clear purpose: description, exploration, tabulation, or decoration\n",
    "- Closely integrated with statistical and verbal descriptions of the data\n",
    "- Graphics should reveal data\n",

    "    1. The representation of numbers, as physically measured in the surface of the graphic itself, should be directly proportional to the numerical quantities represented\n",
    "    2. Clear, detailed, and thorough labelling should be used to defeat graphical distortion and ambiguity. Write out explanations of the data on the graphic. Label important events in the data\n",
    "    3. Show data variation, not design variation\n",
    "    4. In time-series displays or money, deflated standardised units of monetary measurement should be used\n",
    "    5. The number of information-carrying (variables) dimensions depicted should not exceed the number of dimensions in the data\n",
    "    6. Graphics must not quote data out of context"
